# stalkerware

This repo started off as a place to dump packet captures of phones running stalkerware. Some of them may be misleading - it's difficult to ensure that all of the stalkerware has been wiped off the phone before installing a new variant, so some captures might contain traffic from multiple types of spyware.

Now, this repo also contains code to measure the prevalence of stalkerware on the Internet, and graphs of the results.
